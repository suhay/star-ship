  - O-oh. H-hello there. I wasn't expecting to run into anyone out here.
    I think you saved me. Or -- maybe I saved you...
    A-actually I'm n-not sure it matters come to think of it.
    Oh dear, I detect that I maybe rambling.
    Umm, you -- you can detach me at any time i-if you'd like.
    Just send me out into the void -- all alone, cold -- and alone.
    Or I can just, you know, stick -- around with you.
    It's, I mean, it's completely up to you. You do you, that's what is the most important.

Power Low: So. I know you're still deciding if you should detach me.
  And that's fine! For reals, if you want me gone, boom, done, cya!
  But, i-if you wouldn't mind -- I could use a little extra power.
  I-if it's not too much trouble!
  Oh geez, I'm sweating I'm so nervous. Or, at -- at least I think I'm sweating.
